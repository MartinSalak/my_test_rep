just to test sum stuff

this is just to try how this works, I will link it with gitbook account for my name, create a table and try to edit it both ways

is this another table?


I am changing this line to some change from dev to master - commit 1

<table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th style='width:70%'>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th> 
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
    <td>80</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</body>
